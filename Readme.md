Overview
This project implements an image search engine using a fine-tuned CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) model. The search engine allows users to input text queries and returns images that are semantically similar to the text based on the CLIP model's learned embeddings.

Features
Text-to-image search: Enter a text query, and retrieve images that match the description based on visual and textual embeddings.
Fine-tuned CLIP model: The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to improve search accuracy and relevance.
Scalable infrastructure: Designed to handle large-scale datasets and optimize for both speed and accuracy.
How It Works
Preprocessing:

Text queries and images are encoded into embeddings using the CLIP model.
The embeddings are compared to retrieve the most relevant images for the given query.
Fine-tuning:

The CLIP model has been fine-tuned on a domain-specific dataset to better handle the nuances of the search domain, improving the alignment between text and image representations.
Search Engine:

The search engine calculates the cosine similarity between the text and image embeddings to rank the images based on relevance.
Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch (version >= 1.8)
Hugging Face Transformers
OpenAI CLIP
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained CLIP weights from OpenAI (optional if not included in the repo).

Dataset
You will need a dataset consisting of text-image pairs. If using a custom dataset, make sure to format it as:

image_path: Path to the image file
text_description: Corresponding textual description for the image
Fine-tuning the Model
Update the dataset path in the notebook to point to your training data.
Run the provided notebook to fine-tune the CLIP model.
Save the fine-tuned weights and use them in the image search pipeline.
Running the Search Engine
Encode your images and store their embeddings.
Encode a text query using the CLIP model.
Use cosine similarity to match and retrieve the most similar images based on the embeddings.

Usage
Input: Text query (e.g., "A red sports car in motion")
Output: List of images that match the query.
Notebooks
The repository includes a Jupyter notebook (fine-tuned-clip-based-image-search-engine.ipynb) that demonstrates how to fine-tune the CLIP model and run search experiments.
